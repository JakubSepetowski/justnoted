##  JustNoted  :blue_book:

JustNoted is a fully responsive note app that allows users to create notes, edit them, mark them as favorites and delete them (the app has a trash function - deleted notes go to the trash first, so if something happens, they can be recovered). In addition, the app has an edit history, so users can see what changes have occurred to a particular note. 

The application has an integrated calendar - when we create a note (with our permission) in the calendar, the application creates a note, so we can easily keep track of what tasks we have for the day. In addition, we can change the color of the note in the calendar from a palette of 7 colors, so we can plan a hierearchy of notes

The application also displays a different quote to the user each time he logs in, so the user can learn many interesting sentences. In the main menu of the app itself, there are 2 fields that serve as higher priority notes.

The application itself requires creating an account - it uses firebase, so you can log in using google. 
It is also possible to customize your profile - change your username, profile picture and change your password. What's more, you can also delete your accoun
